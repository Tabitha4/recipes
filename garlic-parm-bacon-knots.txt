INGREDIENTS:
 16 slices raw bacon
 4 cloves garlic finely minced
 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
 1/2 tbsp finely chopped parsley

 DIRECTIONS:

 -Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with foil and then parchment paper.

 -Slightly stretch out one slice of bacon and tie into a loose knot. Then tie another knot on top. This double knot should prevent your bacon knots from shrinking too much. Place onto baking sheet and repeat with remaining bacon, spacing about 1/2 inch apart.

 -Evenly sprinkle bacon knots with between 1/16- 1/8 tsp minced garlic. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook 10-15 minutes until bacon is cooked.

 -Sprinkle bacon evenly with cheese and then parsley. Place back into the oven and cook an additional 5-10 minutes until bacon has reached your desired doneness.
